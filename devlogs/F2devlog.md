## How we satisfied the software requirements
1. The game uses the same 3D rendering and physics simulation identified by the team for F1 or suitable replacements that still satisfy the F1 requirements.
    - The game has the same tech stack described in F1 with cannon and three. All F1 requirements remain satisfied.
2. The game must allow the player to move between scenes (e.g. rooms)
    - The player may move between rooms via keyboard controls and mouse movement.
3. The game must allow the player to select specific objects in a scene for interaction (e.g. tapping an item to pick it up or examine it)
    - The player may interact/click in order to play through the mini games.
4. The game maintains an inventory system allowing the player to carry objects so that what happens in one scene has an impact on what is possible in another scene.
    - The inventory system remains consistent throughout all room updates and displays the item or spaces taken.
5. The game contains at least one physics-based puzzle that is relevant to the player's progress in the game.
    - The player may click the buttons in the correct order and pick up a block to place in a portal. The player may play basketball 
6. The player can succeed or fail at the physics-based puzzle on the basis of their skill and/or reasoning (rather than luck).
    - The player may succeed by inputting the correct pattern for Simon Game, shooting in the basket for Basketball Game, or rolling the value in the Dice Game. The player fails due to incorrect input of a pattern, missing the basket, or failing to predict the dice roll.
7. Via play, the game can reach at least one conclusive ending.
    - The player may escape or fail depending on gameplay.

## Reflection
- Our team's plan has stayed somewhat the same as we chose to stay with the same tech stack with cannon and three.
- The plan only has differed in a way that offers refinement and expanding on certain mechanics.
- There is now an inventory system that remains consistent throughout the puzzle instead of just carrying an object.
- The failure condition for the puzzle has changed where the player can now fail by inputting the incorrect input pattern as it makes the successes or failures more clear cut.
- There is a more conclusive fail ending now as supposed to the fail ending prior where it's just the player stuck there for eternity until they solve it.
